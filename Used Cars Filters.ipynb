No wreck history, only two owners, no smokers and although the miles are high, the owner has invested a lot of time and care into this car since ownership three years ago. The list below are all repairs made by the seller in the last year, to assure it is ready to sell. The interior and exterior have minor wear and tear. The drive train is in great condition as well. The AC has a minor leak that needs repairing, but that is a minimal cost for the value bought in the car.   Items replaced or updated: New transmission at 190,000 miles. At 215,000 miles new tires, brakes, drums, air filter, alternator, battery, and radiator.   If interested please text/sms with full first and last name if interested in viewing, test driving, or have follow up questions to the posting.\n"

      "Description Gorgeous straight gloss black 1968 Firebird with blacked out front/rear bumpers and window trim. Drives and runs good.  Narrowed up posi rear end and custom axles approximately 2” per side allowing centerline rims and BF Goodrich tires to fit perfectly without rubbing the inner/outer fender well. This car has it’s own unique look.   Factory traction bars. 4 speed Muncie transmission with a vertical inline shifter. Hays heavy duty clutch. Doug Thorley headers, and an HEI distributor. Nice rumble but not too loud.  I purchased the car in 1987 with 86,000 miles. At that time the 350 engine had just been rebuilt to stock. Recently I rebuilt the quadrajet carburetor and installed a slightly larger cam, The car now has 108,000 miles. The car was partially restored in the mid 90s which included new quarter panels, carpet and headliner. The floor and trunk are solid. Since then I have put on very few miles. Unfortunately the car sat in storage for several years so interior has a musty/mouse smell. The car does have a few small blemishes/flaws in the paint (see pictures) Virtually no rust other than slight surface rust in engine compartment.  Recently:  New custom stereo w/bluetooth am/fm, auxiliary (Still trying to wire it in) new front/rear speakers. New gas tank w/sending unit. New brakes and brake cylinders. New power steering pump. New alternator. New starter.  Areas that could use attention: Dash lights, right front blinker, gas gauge, blower motor currently not working, tachometer not always accurate. Heat control lever sticks, windshield wiper fluid reservoir is not installed, I left the auto choke off the carburetor.   Please Call or text   show contact info    $22,500\n",

      "Description I have a good running International bus for sale. It has 8,800 hours on it. The odometer is Showing 51000 miles and it seems to be correct. On the car fax it shows the mileage following that amount and it was reported as 49, 000 but the next DMV wrote 149000. So we put mileage unknown. The main issue is it needs a paint job because it's painted like a cow. If you work for chick Fil-A it would be perfect. The bus has 175 horse power which is what this international had back in the 90s. It would be great in the flatter regions of the US. The mountains aren't the best for it. The emergency brake is not working properly so I have lowered my price.\n",

Hi tech includes fuel injection, solar backup power with inverter for power while you sit and relax with the built in DVR. Forward and rear video cameras, CB and PA, Just put brand new road tires on and have another set for mud or sand. This is a tribute buggy to all of our veterans and law enforcement as you can tell by the paint, not stickers, painted. Everywhere you go, people love this machine and want to check it out. Next to the solar switch you will find the switch for blue LEDs that light up your undercarriage as a tribute to law enforcement.

I live on Merritt Island and if you are local you have seen this machine on the 520 or Cocoa Beach. Of course I have all paperwork and title. Warning; Because of the Patriotic theme, this vehicle tends to trigger Liberals so you want to stay vigilant and watch your six as you proudly support our Military, Law Enforcement and First Responders.

It ran and drove fine and has been in our Desert valley, NO Rain, NO Snow, NO Salt, NO Rust, for over 30 years. An extensive restoration was started but hasn’t been completed. NO Dents, NO Smashes, minor dings were repaired, original paint was sanded and primed in prep for repaint Has all bumpers, brackets, correct and complete trim and emblems. It’s all there, all connected, all the hard expensive work has been done, it’s ready to finish and GO !!!

      "Description I have a 2011 F-350, Diesel engine, 4x4, Dually axle, service truck. What you see in picture is what it is. Service bed is steel and is empty but we pump portable toilets so it will smell inside. Why is this retired? Age and Ford said we needed to replace engine after losing compression in a couple cylinders - IT DOES NOT RUN - needs to be towed from Base - Sat for several months now.  Has 186k on clock. Had radiator replaced at 180k, DPF system replaced at 179k, rear end replaced/rebuilt at FORD at 176k, brakes and booster at 175k, Engine replaced at 151k at Ford and had problems with it ever since warranty ran out. This has been fleet maintained every 5k.  I am looking for best offer with no BS. Titled out of our Montana Office and is in company name. This will be a cash only sale.  Looking for best offer\n",

I took it to the mechanic shop and they told me cylinder 2 is not making any pressure, and that they have to open the head to check it. Over the last few months, I put new clutch from dealership ($6800)  then new Air Dryer+new coolant tank+ New Brakes +New Oil pumps+ six new tiers.

      "Description 1958 Ford Custom 300 w/ Chevy 305 motor and 2 speed power Glyde.  $9,000 OBO.    When was the last time you saw one of these?   You see mostly 4 doors.  This bad boy has lots of character and style - hood, trunk, fender skirts, dash....the list goes on.    Buff this car up and the Patina will shine through.   Car was built at Dallas TX plant and is a TX car.  Has been in TX storage for 30 plus years until I purchased it.    I have done the following:  new tires, new gas tank and sender, new plugs and wires, coolant and oil, new master cylinder, new wheel cylinders and front brake shoes.    This car has a VERY straight body w/ very little rust.  Everything works - lights, blinkers, windows, cranks;    Motor could use some ignition and carburetor tuning.  I was going to swap a 351W but decided to let the Ford guys do what they want with it.    The tuck and roll interior is in good shape and has a great body.  Just enough style to have a nice cruiser for pretty cheap.  Headliner is sagging but is a pretty easy fix.     This one will go fast.  Might be interested in trades for something of equal value.    Thanks.    show contact info\n",

      "Description PLEASE READ ALL THE ADD BEFORE ASKING IF ITS STILL FOR SALE !!!!!!    I have a very solid, very original 1959 Studebaker Silverhawk !!!! it has the 259 V8 and the automatic transmission. It runs well and was a daily driver for the PO. It had set for a few years due to death of the owner,, I have cleaned out old gas,,added new battery,, new master cylinder for brakes,, and its running better all the time. I would not plan on driving it home,, the brakes still need adjusting and bled,,brakes work but needs adjusting.  It looks as if it was restored about 10 years ago,, yes there is a small run in the paint ,, bumpers and chrome have some pitting. But it is really solid,,I have found no rust in the car. floors are solid,,as is panels.   These are hard to find and even harder to find is one that drives and runs good for a fair price. Lights and turn signals work,,has electric fuel pump,,it will be a great cruiser with very little work.. if you are looking for a show car,,this isnt for you, it is a very solid driver !!!   Text me at 812 five 6 nine 0328 between 8am and 7pm Eastern time ONLY !! and i will get back to you NO DREAMERS,, HAVE CASH READY TO BUY...Thanks Darrell\n",

      "Description This 1965 Chrysler Newport Classic is a nice daily driver for the past 1 1/2 years and has been well cared for prior to that.  Starts, runs, drives and stops great.  Engine has no smoke or noise and no overheating, transmission shifts smooth on time in all 3 gears no slipping or jerking, some fluids seeping no leaks.  Battery is only 2 years old, alternator is new, tires are only a few years old, no shaking or vibration while driving at high speeds.  Breaks work perfectly no noise or pulling in any direction.  Head lights, running lights, brake lights, windshield wipers radio and gas gauge all work.  Turn signals not working, horn not working, speedometer/odometer not working I recently disconnected speedometer because it was bouncing around and making tons of noise.  All windows roll up and down easily and the glass is in great shape all around. Headliner has been removed, rods to replace it are in the trunk, sun visors are in bad shape, the rest of the interior is in very good condition considering the age of the car.  A/C not working but totally complete.  Heat, A/C switches and fan work as they should. The rust you see in one of the last few pictures is the only rust on or under the entire car, oddest thing I've ever seen, not even rusty bolts under the car and nothing missing or rusty from the trunk or inner quarter panels. This car would be considered \"RUST FREE\" if it were not for the rear quarter rust. The paint is original the trim and chrome are not pitted, shiny and in very good condition.  Passenger side rear bumper and quarter panel have back up damage.  The car runs and drives well and in my opinion it could travel long distance with very little service (oil change, transmission flush, etc.    Asking $3800 Or Best Cash Offer, contact Larry  show contact info  anytime.\n",

      "Description Here is a complete 1963 Corvair that was restored 30 years ago. It was last registered in 1997 and the last time it was driven was 5 years ago.   This is the more desirable upscale 900 series Monza model that came with a long list of factory upgrades. The seats that are currently in the car do not look original, they may have come from an early 70’s Chevrolet product like a Camaro.  The motor looks intact as does the exterior body. After the restoration, it was always either garaged or stored under cover after the restoration. As a result, there is no visible rust on the body.  The car is painted a pretty metallic Root Beer color and the Coupe’s top was painted a contrasting tan color.  STZTA\n",

      "Description Very clean, low mileage bus that would be excellent an RV conversion or for a rafting/adventure outfitter. It will need a new/used ECM in order to run, but aside from that it really is in excellent condition. The tires are great, the interior is very good, the engine is the very reliable DT466 which we have in most of our buses and is extremely low miles because it was an activities bus (field trips, team events, etc.) We purchased it from the Lagrangeville School district for $15000 with the intention of bringing it to Colorado for our rafting company. Unfortunately the ECM broke on I-84 just outside of Middletown. By the time we were able to determine what the issue was we were into the Covid lockdown, and now we're into our season and cannot come to get it, so we're selling. It is at the International bus repair shop in Middletown which will ONLY install brand-new International parts (running about $4000). A refurbished ECM runs less than $1000 and just about any diesel repair shop should be able to install it.  YES, we are taking a big hit on this between the purchase price and the shop bill. NO, this is not a scam - we just don't have the time right now, nor do I want to fly back out there to get it. This was a great deal when we bought it ($25-30000 if we bought the same bus from a dealer), but it isn't going to work out for us. If you are up for putting in the ECM it could be an awesome deal for you.  Thanks for looking. Be safe. Email me if you have questions or would like to schedule a time to check it out.  - Jeremy\n",

      "Description 2008 Corvette base, has the LS3 6.2 rated at 430hp, its a automatic with paddle shift, car has muffler delete other then that its bones stock  performance wise.  Has 5% tint on the windows, all the lighting has been wrapped in a smoke tint and can be removed easily.  I don't think you can find a better bang for your buck vehicle. With that being said this is a 12 year old black car so it's not perfect. Paint is in decent shape but could use a cut and buff, it has a small chip out of the passengers door(last picture) a used door can be had for $500 off ebay. The car could use some tires. I hadn't replaced them as I was waiting for a certain set of wheels to come off of backorder.  However the car is very solid and runs well. I would go anywhere with the car. It does have 127k miles on it. But it runs awesome and is a fun car. Clean clear title in hand asking $15500.00 I'm not forced to sell so please don't waste your time and mine with low ball offers. No joy rides. 406-six nine eight- 9136\n",

      "Description Early 70's Ford Boom truck. This truck is one awesome tool. It has a fully functioning 35ft boom that had no problem lifting a 27ft 16\" ridge beam in place. It also was capable of lifting bundles of 20, 10\" wall logs averaging 12-14ft a piece. Approx 3500 pounds a bundle. The flat bed makes makes an excellent working platform. Boom controls are on both driver and passenger side of the truck enabling the operator to visualize the boom and hook on either side of the truck. This truck would be a perfect addition to a lumber mill or anywhere the truck could work on site. This truck does fine moving around and relocating on site but it is not ready to deploy around town on jobs. The 460 industrial motor is weak but the hydrolics are strong, sound, and operate great with the motor at an idle. If the motor was replaced and a little TLC this truck would be a money maker. Average crane rental is at least $100 an hour. $8000 OBO willing to entertain partial trades on material for home construction.\n",

      "Description For Sale: 1946 Ford Super Deluxe Sedan with a flathead V8. Owned by the same family from the late 1950's until I purchased it from them. They parked it in dry garage in 1987 because it needed new wheel cylinders for the brakes and it never made it back into service after that. The mileage is original at 91,562 and there are still oil change stickers in the door jambs from the 1970's showing service mileage in the 8X,XXX. I've had it indoors since I purchased it from the family, and have too many projects at this time to get it back on the road. It has a lot of potential. There are some pieces of thin metal (inner wheel well shields that are long gone) that need to be replaced but overall it's a very solid car. It was used as a spare car for that family from the late 1960's until the early 80's and I believe that's what kept it so solid for a Northeast car. It is still an original 6 volt positive ground wiring system.   I put a new 6 volt battery in on 9-2-20 and it cranks over good. I have not had time to go through the fuel system and I have not had the time to go over the brakes. It will need to be fully gone over before hitting the road but it's all there and not in 37 baskets and 189 pieces like most cars its age.   Call or text anytime  (5seven0)87eight-9two9zero. Clear PA title in my name, no trades please I need the garage space for another truck. Thank you!\n",

White 2014 Mitsubishi i-MiEV ES RWD 1-Speed Automatic AC Synchronous Electric Motor126/99 City/Highway MPGReviews: * If youre looking for a low-priced electric car, the 2014 Mitsubishi i-MiEV is a contender. Though not as polished as the Ford Focus or Nissan Leaf electric cars, the i-MiEV is doable if limited to urban runs in warm-weather climates. Source: KBB.com * Affordable price; crisp response and easy maneuverability in city traffic. Source: Edmunds * The Mitsubishi i-MiEV is a pure-electric vehicle with loads of personality. It is the ultimate eco trip with the power to save and the power to surprise. The i-MiEV produces zero emissions, has no tailpipe, and makes no sound. With an EPA-rated 112 miles per gallon equivalent when you compare the electricity cost to gasoline, the i-MiEV is one of the most eco-friendly, efficient vehicles available. Designed to inhabit cityscapes, the i-MiEV's 62-mile range is ideal for most commuters, featuring 3 drive modes (performance, efficiency or regenerative braking) to give you custom performance for your unique life and driving style. Along with responsive handling, a tight turning radius, it's easy to see how this urban dweller has become a true citizen of the globe. Every detail on an i-MiEV is designed for maximum efficiency, from its engineering to its expressive styling. LED tail lamps, regenerative brakes, a lightweight bodyframe and a nonexistent tailpipe all contribute to making sure that every amp, every watt, every volt are accounted for, and used with purpose. The custom-made Lithion-ion batteries are safely mounted to the Reinforced Impact Safety Evolution body, feature two cooling systems, and are warrantied for 8 years or 100,000 miles. There are three ways to charge the vehicle: standard cable (22.5 hours), EVSE home dock (7 hours), and the ultra-fast public quick-charger port (30 minutes to 80%). The i-MiEV comes equipped with an impressive array of safety features including Active Stability Control, available rearview camera and Approaching Vehicle Alert System, which helps make the stealthy i-MiEV a little bit less so. Save money and the planet by going green with the Mitsubishi i-MiEV today!

      "Description 1997 Firebird Formula with a little over 136k on the odometer. 5.7 liter LT1 V8 with a T56, 6 speed manual transmission. Only had the car a few months but I did change oil and filter with Mobil 1 full synthetic and changed transmission fluid with STP auto transmission fluid with Dexron.  T tops seal tight and weather stripping is in good shape. Pop up headlights work. Full true dual exhaust ( very very loud) and a cold air intake with K&N air filter.   I don’t know much about this cars history but it does start right up and runs well.  Body has rock chips and has been touched up in the past. Car is dirty in the pics but the pavement reflecting on the paint makes it look worse than it is.  Corvette wheels all around, they’re in good shape.  Some of the center caps have some oxidation.  Last of this style of drivers focused cars, manual transmission, V8, T Tops , pop up headlights.   You’ll never see cars like these made again due crash regulations.  I don’t need help selling and if you aren’t really interested don’t waste either of our time. I’m willing to negotiate on the price and would like to see someone who appreciates cars ( an enthusiast) get it, but I don’t need to sell it I more need the parking space. So don’t lowball me (740) 29 six- 3 zero 92 $4500 obo   Mileage will increase some as I do drive it\n",

      "Description 2017 Chevrolet Express . Condition was Certified pre-owned when I purchased this in 7/19.  I am not entirely sure that it is transferable or not.  It does have the existing full factory warranty today.    This van gets crazy good mpg.  I have had several diesel vans before, including ford 7.3's and a couple sprinters.  The 7.3 could get 20 mpg with the right axle ratio and the sprinter did better but they are very utilitarian.  I just took this to San Diego and back for thanksgiving and was getting 28 mpg on the freeway doing 70 ish.  That is awesome for a 12 passenger van    I just got back from Idaho with this van and was getting crazy good mpg.  In Nevada and Idaho the speed limit it 80 mph I was still getting at least 28 mpg  This has all the bells and whistles.   It is a LT model back up camera,  navigation,  front and rear a/c and heat,  factory tinted windows,  auto with the manual trans button,  exhaust brake,  both front power seats,  keyless entry, cruise,  110 plug in the dash with usb inputs,  carpet,  tilt, hands free phone, tow hitch, pop out windows in the back, shoulder seat belts in the back, you can take out half of the back seat and leave the other side, there may be a few more things in there too that I am not aware of.  The seats are clean as new.  There are floor mats for every row, Cup holders here and there. It is very quite while driving.  Compared to my 7.3 we could not talk to each other much especially the kids in the back.  This van is so quiet you can talk to the back seat riders at a normal tone.    The tires are original and good.  The oil change is recent and not due for a bit.   Mechanically it needs nothing and is under warranty anyway.  The first year GM leased this van to themselves and I have seen them do this a lot.  I have looked for the chevy diesel vans for years in a passenger type and for several years chevy made them for themselves only. A chevy dealer bought it from Gm to resell and I bought it from the chevy dealer.  The bummer part is that during transport to me the roof received some damage and has been fixed.  It is not as perfect as it was before but if you want a van that gets 28 mpg and is mechanically perfect but has what looks like hail damage on the roof make an offer. New these are 45000.    I have driven it about 7500 miles.  If you have questions call me at 530-365-8913 west coast time between 9-6 mon-sat.  If you want to check it out in person call for an appt first please.  I hope you get this far in the ad.  Please don't compare this to a gas engine van.  There is a world of difference in value.  If you need a loan to buy this you will need a down payment because book value of rare vehicles hardly ever comes out enough.  Book values work for camrys and accords, they are mass produced and can be found everywhere.  When there are only 3 vehicles for sale in the country at the same time KBB isn't going to work.  That being said, I will look at offers.  Please don't try and tell me that this is worth 25k and leave me a bad google review because you are looking out of your budget like the last guy that never even looked at the van.  Thanks in advance.   Mercedes only  6050 hwy 273 anderson 530-365-8913\n",

It was built in Van Nuys California and was a factory white car. The frame has been cleaned and painted, new springs front and rear, new ball joints, tie rod parts, bearings, seals and brakes.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation.

      "Description 1952 Chevy Fleetline fastback 2dr sedan with over 2k in new parts. No motor/trans. When I got this car, the owners had started work on it. The floor was rusty, so they cut it out. I bought a new complete floor pan for it. Goes from the back seat all the way to the front, and has all the floor braces already welded in place. ( see photo ). I also have rear lower quater panel repair panels, new gas tank and straps, new outer and inner rockers for both sides. Prior owner had sanded the body, so we shot a coat of urethane primer on it for protection. Back glass is perfect, frame is solid, upper body is good as well. Have good straight bumpers, a grille, loads of side chrome trim. Car has unmolested dash. Tennessee title.

Source: Edmunds  * The Chevrolet Volt electric plug-in hybrid represents a unique twist on the hybrid-car theme. The Volt runs purely on electric current. Once its battery pack's estimated range of 38 mile is depleted the Volt's gasoline engine kicks on to run a generator, powering the electric motor and helping recharge the batteries. This extends the Volt's range an additional 300 miles or more. The Volt features a Hold mode in its drive selection to conserve battery charge, and a no-cost-option low-emissions package qualifies the Volt for single-occupancy HOV lanes in California and New York. The Hold mode is useful, for example, when driving on a freeway heading into the city, where you'll want the full electric charge available. The Volt's electric motor delivers a big dose of torque right from the get-go, letting the car sprint away quickly from a standing start. The interior is covered in bright white and dark accented plastics and touch-sensitive controls for the audio and climate-control functions. Two 7-inch LCD screens replace the traditional analog gauges, with one serving as the instrument cluster (speedometer, fuel, and range gauges) and the other mounted atop the center stack displaying the electric motor/battery operation as well as the available navigation screen. With the goal of total operating efficiency, the Volt's design team crafted a body shape that could cheat the wind. Up front are a rounded nose, closed grille opening and steeply raked windshield. Sharp edges along the Volt's rear fenders help slice through the wind, as does the functional rear hatch spoiler. New for 2015, Volt has available OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity essentially turning your car in to a WiFi hotspot on wheels.

Up till then start and run every month till it didn’t even click and got busy so there you go. ( Just charged up the battery for 2 days and it is DEAD ) You will need to TOW & or TRAILER the Jeep from property. No Leaks – Oil and water and steering all where they should be.. the Ransey winch has a leak underneath So with that, a good tune up kit, (w/ Distributor cap. Coil. Plugs. oil & air fuel filter $75 ) a new battery ( Maybe) and solenoid and you should be running to start. Should also replace the belts (2) & hoses (2) Spare Water pump provided. The ambulance rear box is rusted out on the roof & has little rust in corners and driver side floor board They used rock wool for the box insulation and with moisture just wasn’t good for this combo of steel. Also would Recommend a New Gas Tank - plastic $179 as the gas has been sitting for years Since the box needs to come off easy to replace the gas tank Again The box isn’t worth saving. make a flat bed.

By 1970, the Gladiator three-quarter-ton model featured a 132-inch wheelbase and gross vehicle weight rating of 7,000 lbs. American Motors Corporation purchased Jeep from Kaiser in 1970 and eliminated the Gladiator nameplate in 1972 to simply call it \"Jeep\" or \"Jeep J-Series.\" When Chrysler purchased Jeep from AMC in 1987, it dropped the J-Series truck line in favor of the Comanche pickups. Chrysler produced the Comanche through 1992. Characteristics The Jeep J20, and its sibling, the J10, featured the same architecture as the Cherokee-Wagoneer. It had the same front axle, dashboard and the optional Quadra-Trac system for four-wheel drive models. The Jeep also shared the Cherokee's body-on-frame truck construction. The J10 and J20 came with the same trim as the Cherokee's Pioneer model. While the J10 featured a 119-inch wheelbase, the J20 was available with the 119-inch wheelbase or the extended 131-inch wheelbase for the long bed version. Under the Hood An AMC 360 cubic-inch V-8 was standard equipment in the Jeep J20. The engine's bore was 4.08 inches and the stroke measured 3.44 inches. It featured an 8.5-to-1 compression ratio and a two-barrel carburetor to generate 175 horsepower and 285 foot-pounds of torque. The optional engine was a four-barrel carburetor version of the 360 that developed 195 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of torque. A three-speed manual was the standard transmission to match the 360, but an optional four-speed manual or General Motors three-speed automatic were available. Dimensions and Capacities The J20 had a front axle capacity of 3,500 lbs. and a rear axle capacity up to 5,500 lbs. The standard rear axle ratio was 3.93-to-1, while the 4.09-to-1 version was optional. The J20 was slightly more versatile than the old Gladiator trucks, with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,000 lbs. The J20's body on the short wheelbase measured 193.6 inches, the same as the J10, and 205.6 inches when placed on the long wheelbase. The body measured 78.9 inches tall, and the truck's profile was tall at 65.9 inches. The cab's legroom was a generous 45 inches and the hip room was 38.3 inches. The gasoline tank held 19 gallons & offered an optional 20-gallon fuel tank.  Standard gear ratios were 3.90 with optional 4.27 & 4.88 in 1/2 & 3/4T models. 1T models came with 4.88 and had 5.89 as an option. Power-Lok limited slips were optional in all models (rear only) Jeep Gladiator / Jeep Pickup Transmission 3-speed manual 4-speed manual 3-speed GM THM400 automatic 3-speed Chrysler A727 automatic Dimensions Wheelbase 120 in (3,048 mm) 126 in (3,200 mm) 132 in (3,353 mm) 165 in (4,191 mm) chassis camper  The 360 was the last AMC V8 to be manufactured. It continued to be produced after Chrysler bought American Motors in 1987 as the standard engine in the Jeep Grand Wagoneer through 1991, with the only modification being the \"360\" casting replaced with \"5.9L\" on the side of the block.[20] AMC 360 V8 Bore x Stroke 4.08\" x 3.44\" Displacement 360(5.89L) Compression Ratio 8.5:1 Horsepower (net) 195@4400 Torque (net) 295@2900 Main Bearings 5 Valve Configuration OHV Fuel 4bbl  The AMC 360 The model designations were simplified for 1974, with the J-2000 and the J-4000, which designate wheelbase, being swapped out for the J-10 and J-20, designating payload capacity. Larger brakes were made standard and the turning radius reduced. The Quadra-Trac system was now available with all engines.[1] The AMC 401 cu in (6.6 L) was offered from 1974 through 1978. These engines are known for their toughness and excellent power output. The 401 produced 225 hp (168 kW; 228 PS) and 320 lb⋅ft (434 N⋅m) of torque. For 1977, Jeep J-10 pickups included Dana's manual four-wheel-drive system, a more powerful 258 cu in (4.2 L) six-cylinder engine, and heavier axle tubes, while power front disc brakes became standard equipment and the considerably greater GWV capacity J-20s included AMC's 360 cu in (5.9 L) V8 engine.[5]  key words Wrangler bug out vehicle j10 j20 Ultimate Survival Vehicle AMC doomsday camper atv hauler 360 engine, 2 barrel carb, 4-speed T-18 Transmission.

This particular generation marks the turning point when Chevy realized it could offer truck buyers modern conveniences and comfort options in the same way it did sedan shoppers—a stunningly simple connection to make in retrospect, but one that blew the market wide open during a time when primary rival Ford steadfastly refusing to build anything other than the most utilitarian models for work use.The end result was a sales phenomenon that would see GM prolong its dominance over the Blue Oval well into the mid-’70s, pushing millions of examples of this generation of truck out of the factories and onto the roads, farm fields, and dusty barns. The 1968–72 C/K proved that you didn’t have to suffer a tin can cabin or a kidney-busting ride to get the job done.Flash-forward to today, and Chevrolet’s past progressive attitude has paid significant dividends for collectors. The driver-friendly nature of these trucks stands in stark contrast to both their predecessors and their contemporaries, the enormous production run guarantees no shortage of drivers or restoration candidates (although cream puffs are another story), and their dead-simple mechanical make them inexpensive to maintain and even easier to update to more modern running gear. These trucks have been climbing in value for over 5 years now with nice examples often pulling $45,000+. Now lets talk about this specific GMC. This is a two owner vehicle from Billings and has been in Montana it's entire life. The nuts and bolts of it are pretty straight forward: 350ci engine mated to a Turbo 350. 12 Bolt rear end with a ratio of 3:08 Gears. The transfer case is a MP 205. This thing is head turning joy to drive. Its hard to think of this as being half a century old. 50 years has not tarnished it, only made it shine brighter and become more desirable.

The airbag did deploy and it has a salvage title.  I will include a new steering wheel airbag and I sent the seatbelts away to get rebuilt.  The brand new tires on it have less than 2 miles on them.  I do have the 5th tire to match the other 4.  It is located at a body shop in Columbus to get the quarter panel pulled out and ready for a new skin.  The asking price is before any work is done to it at the body shop.  I will sell it without the new wheels and tires for less money.  I also already have replacement fender flares and the left rear taillight.  Please text or call  show contact info\n",

Escondido Auto Super Center    Year: 2017 Make: Chevrolet Model: Sonic Series: LT VIN: 1G1JD5SG1H4138790 Stock #: 19647 Condition: Used Mileage: 130,986 MPG: 24 city / 34 highway Exterior: Kinetic Blue Metallic Interior: Jet Black Body: Sedan Transmission: Automatic Engine: 1.8L 4 Cylinders Drivetrain: Front Wheel Drive     With 10 service bays  we can now provide even better service to our loyal customers. Our dealership is founded on the principles of selling quality cars at the best prices with a no-pressure environment. It makes sense to purchase a pre-owned automobile rather than a brand new car. Since new cars depreciate rapidly during the first few years, the financial savings and future resale value of a high quality used vehicle is quite compelling.  ➩ 📲 ☎️️ CALL OR TEXT (760) 349-4298 FOR PRE-APPROVAL  ♫♫ EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE SINCE 1994!!! ♫♫  📌BAD CREDIT, NO CREDIT-- NO PROBLEM❕  📌BANKRUPTCY, MESSY DIVORCE-- NO PROBLEM❕  📌GET PRE-APPROVED IN A MINUTES: http://www.escoauto.com/pre-approval.aspx  📌RATES AS LOW AS 1.99%  📌INSTANT CASH OFFER-FOR TRADE-INS 💲💲💲  📌TRADE-INS WELCOME!

      "Description Up for sale is my 1968 Dodge A100. The Van Is located in Goleta,California. IF THIS POST IF STILL UP, THE VAN IS STILL AVAILABLE. I WILL TAKE THIS DOWN WHEN I SEE IT DRIVE AWAY WITH NEW OWNER.  EMAILS SENT WITHOUT PHONE NUMBERS WILL BE IGNORED. NOT LOOKING TO PART OUT AT THIS TIME.   PLEASE READ ENTIRE AD BEFORE CONTACTING. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY, LET’S NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME.  This van has a lot of great potential. It has current registration, does run and has a CLEAN TITLE in hand in. It runs great and has been recently tuned up. New plugs,wires,cap, rotor, etc I purchased it with the intention of restoring it but I no longer have the space for it so it unfortunately has to go. It is currently powered by a 360 engine (that was swapped in before I bought it) and a 3 speed manual on the column. There are a few performance parts on the engine like the edlebrock 4 barrel carb and manifold. Because I do not see myself being able to purchase another one of these vans any time soon, I will also be including A TON of parts that have been collected over the years. Basically will be filling the back of the van with hard to find spares. Long tube headers, 727 automatic trans with shifter, spare grills and bumpers, etc (SEE PHOTO) All of the glass is installed and intact, (also have spares for those) The Van currently sits on a set of original steel wheels. The van shows 42464 on the dash. This van has a lot of potential to be a great cruiser or an awesome vintage camping experience.  There is some minor front end damage, which didn't bother me as I purchased it this way and there is some rust around the roof panel. and in the front passenger side dogleg. I have attached photos of the worst spots. It had also been repainted at some point but probably could be cleaned up if desired. All can be easily addressed/repaired for little money if you want to make it perfect. I am also including a BRAND NEW TMNT Dodge A100 Van toy, just in case you need some inspiration for the van.  If you're looking for a Rare vintage cruiser, a camper, work truck or just a unique automobile, this is it!  Email to set up appointment to see the van, EMAILS SENT WITHOUT A PHONE NUMBER TO CONTACT YOU WILL BE IGNORED. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY, LET’S NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME.  THANK YOU !\n",

      "Description 1998 VW Beetle TDI for sale. 206K miles. Engine was rebuilt around 140K according to the previous owner. 5 speed manual, has roof racks. Cat back straight pipes. Supposedly you can get 50 mpg, The best Ive done is 42 mpg. The car has a vegetable oil conversion in it, single tank version. I have the paperwork for it. I spoke to the guy who installed it. I only run diesel in it, as should you unless diesel goes over $4/ gallon otherwise its a waste of money. I have a bunch of paperwork that goes along with it and possibly a vagcom cable and computer (the necessary equipment to access the cars computer). Runs and drives incredibly well. You might want to do the ball joint on the passenger side, I have both ball joints from AC Delco, never got around to doing them. I drove it on them the way it is now. I also have an extra set of wheels and tires for the car that I have never mounted. If you have a long commute, this is the car for you! Im looking for $3,000 OBO and am a motivated seller. Buying a new truck and want to put the money towards that. Im pretty sure I have the title, but you won't need it to register in CT since its more than 20 years old.\n",

We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation.

      "Description 1966 Chevrolet Corvair Monza with Rare Air Conditioning  This is a very clean original southern car.  It has the 110 HP motor, Very rare Dual exhaust, factory A/C, factory tinted windows, wire wheels. This car had the motor rebuilt recently and new interior headliner to carpet. Dash, door panels, rear folding seat are all in excellent condition. I put this car on the lift and couldn't believe how clean everything is. Really excellent, see pics. The A/C compressor was not put back in when the motor was rebuilt but is with the car. The rest of the A/C, condenser and all brackets are all still in the car. Looks like just put back the compressor, all the brackets are still attached so it looks pretty easy. All of the lights, blinkers, horn, everything works as it should.   Very cool car and a blast to drive. Really has some get up and go. It had a repaint at some time in its life and looks near perfect. There are a few very small touch ups done to very small chips and that's it. There is one small rust spot that needs to be addressed in the front left quarter panel on top.  I have included a walk around video which gives you a good feel for the car. Hit the key and it's running.  Video link   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y9HwCWmLH4       If you want more pics or have any questions feel free to ask.  Any questions, please ask.   I have a Florida Title with a bill of sale so it can go anywhere. I am more than happy to help load with any transport outfit you may choose. Thank You in advance.\n",

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tAccessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or  omissions.

      "Description Rare to find 2015 Dodge Charger Pursuit AWD V8. These cars are only sold to state or federal government groups in this trim (2015 and up,V8,AWD). These cars combine most of the features of the Charger R/T with the amazing AWD system that is configurable (AWD/4WD/RWD). Civilian chargers are no longer sold with AWD and V8 options, only 4/6 cylinder options. The 5.7 Gen 3 V8 is extremely rugged and produces  370HP and 395 Ft lbs of torque, almost 100 more than the highest civilian model in AWD. I have owned a different one of these (copy of the same) for over a year now and for a daily driven car, I would not pick any other due to the power, reliability, space, traction and comfort.   Clean title in hand, never been in an accident, emission tested (NM) and no service engine lights, tires are fairly new, 120k mile service/preventive maintenance already completed (trans. flush, brakes pads/rotors, serpentine, diff. fluid check, oil, coolant, ect.).  Cash/loans only (no trades). VIN available on request. Private buyers only, no flippers. Please call or text me. 5o536343o3  Please look into the links provided to better understand what this vehicle offers. Thank you.  https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15106607/2015-dodge-charger-pursuit-v-8-awd-test-review/ https://www.tflcar.com/2015/07/2015-dodge-charger-police-pursuit-test-drive/ https://www.zautomotive.com/product/tazer/  This car is a retired fleet vehicle from a state facility that was professionally maintained under contract. Car is in great condition, and given its capabilities, it's really a treat to drive. Chrysler/Dodge designed these vehicles to last for 250-300k miles. These cars take the same interior and exterior parts as any other 2015-2020 Charger which means its very simple to find spare parts or after market accessories. In addition, the pursuit models have beefier sway and suspension parts than the normal vehicles. Car is detailed and cleaned inside and out. The best part really is the addition of the updated front and rear fascia and LED accented headlights, which really sets these apart from previous models and gives the vehicle a much better look on the road.   Normal Driver Perspective: These cars are great commuters with a very high safety rating. This car has the big brake system from the factory which offers 14.5\" rotors on the front and 13.7\" on the back. Visibility is great and this car is very spacious. Car gets about 16-17 mpg city and gets 25 mpg freeway thanks to MDS, which can be disabled. Front are clothes seats and rear are vinyl leather. The driver seat is fully powered in all directions (2015). The 5 speed transmission gets the same fuel economy as the 8 speed ZF versions in these cars (Tested). The trunk on the pursuits is extra large, and includes a full size spare  which is very difficult to find on modern sedans. The car is push to start, bluetooth capable, and dual zone climate controlled. The 5\" touch screen controls everything in tandem with the LCD dash (2015 and new Chargers). The 5\" display can also be swapped for a 8.4\" display with or without Android/Apple Auto. Additionally, the car accepts a factory rear view camera which would display through whichever touch screen you have installed. The car has the pursuit console installed, but can be converted for a few hundred dollars with the normal Charger/Challenger center console (pictured in one of my other Chargers).  Using the Tazer OBD system, the Automatic AWD system can be changed to either forced AWD (4WD) or RWD by using the steering wheel AUX button (while stopped) which is ideal for snow/gravel or fuel economy cruising respectively.  The car includes steel wheels with hub caps, but can take normal Charger/Challenger alloy wheels or after market wheels with a specific offset (+38mm).Spotlight is also included, but can be removed by request of ownership.  Performance Driver Perspective: These cars are sought after as the 5.7 hemi is capable of quite a bit of power, on levels beyond the 6.4 (392) and 6.2 Hellcat with bolt-ons, cams, and power adders. The 5.7s also share the same format as the other engines, meaning that those engines can be bolted onto the NAG1/TC in these cars. 600-650HP is the limit for most of these engines/drive trains before more serious modifications are required. The car already has big brakes (14.5\", 13.7\"), and with the Tazer OBD system, allows the driver to switch drive train modes, as well as unlock the SRT functions of the car including line lock and possibility of adding paddle shifters (I have added them into my personnel car). These cars will out perform normal Charges in most aspects, and the only draw back is the 150 added pounds from the AWD system, making the car weigh 4300 lbs. They can be lightened quite easily as well. On my personnel vehicle, I have installed fully adjustable coil overs which are specific to the AWD version, and not difficult to add.\n",

      "Description 2013 Ford Cmax energi for sale  I am the original owner of this vehicle and it has been well taken care of and really is in almost like new condition, as you can see by the pics and will confirm in person. If you see this car in person, I am sure you will agree it is in as good or better condition than any of the ones available at dealerships.  Things to know before you buy this car.  • Cmax Energi was only made for 5 years 2013 thru 2017, after which Ford discontinued the model. With the exception of a few minor trim package variations, Ford never modified this vehicle with any changes to the body style, interior, or mechanical basics. Meaning there is virtually no difference between a 2013 or 2017 model. They did have two basic option packages one with the backup camera and one without. See the attached JD powers to see that the 2013 model was actually ranked by them as tied with the 2017 model for highest review rating of 4.8 So knowing that, the year made has little to no bearing on this cars value, what matters, is the miles the car has been driven, how well the car was taken of and what physical condition it is in NOW.  • Most people mistakenly think that only new electric or plug in hybrids quality for any rebates or tax credits, or other perks that would enhance the value of purchasing a vehicle or give the buyer other incentives to switch. THAT IS NOT TRUE. There are rebates and perks that you may qualify for if you purchase this used car.  • Anyone who purchases this car will quality to get special SDGE reduced electrical rates for your entire home, as little as $0.09/KWhr. To see SDGE pricing plans available to you when you purchase this vehicle go to: https://www.sdge.com/residential/pricing-plans/about-our-pricing-plans/electric-vehicle-plans  • Also on SDGE website they talk about offering a $1,000.00 rebate for the purchase of a plug in hybrid or electric vehicle to qualifying teachers and first responders, while the money allotted for that program lasts. They are unclear whether that program is for new or used cars, but you can find out more by going here: https://www.sdge.com/residential/electric-vehicles/champions-clean-air-ev-rebate  • The State of California passed a bill last year that now includes used EV and Plug in Hybrids in their rebate program. The program was just starting to be promoted by local air quality control boards when Covid hit. LA and Orange County are already set up to offer these. SD county is not on the list yet, but may be added to it when their offices open after covid, since they are now shut down. Learn more about that program here: https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/msprog/lct/vehiclescrap.htm  • The State of California in that same bill they extended and expanded the issuance of highway carpool lane stickers to both new and used EV and plugin hybrids. For only a $22.00 issuance fee attached to your application you can get a sticker that allows a single driver to use the carpool lanes any time of the day. When I purchased this car new that was one of the primary perks that motivated me. At the time, I was still working full time and driving all over town often during rush hour. I really missed that when my decal expired. Now you can get a new decal and get the same perk. You can apply for that decal here: https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/current-clean-air-vehicle-decal  If you need to drive in your car alone to or for work like I did or you often drive alone to visit family in LA, Orange county or further north, you will really appreciate having that decal.  I am probably a horrible salesperson, but I firmly believe in honesty and only want to sell this car to someone who will love it. So here is the truth about this car.  I have had a love – hate relationship with this car since the day I bought it. As I will explain I have personally fixed a few of the things I hated (no thanks to Ford and their useless extended warrantee) and I still love the things I always loved. I like this car enough to keep it a lot longer as my only vehicle. The reason I am selling is because I could not resist buying a new Tesla Y, I just got it, and it is incredible! If after reading this add you decide to buy a Tesla instead, use my referral link to get a $1000 free super charger miles or a $250 discount on a new solar system. Here is the link: https://ts.la/danilo56279  If a new Tesla is out of your budget and this car I am selling is in it, keep on reading. Here are things I love about this car and why I bought it. First you need to know I am 6’ 7” tall, so fitting into a car is the first test for any car I buy. And this car passes it easily. Way more spacious on the inside than any of the Prius models I sat in before I found this car.  1. So, Driver Head and Leg room, is great.  2. Love the overall mileage even though the posted estimates were very inaccurate. The average mpg varied depending upon the kind of driving you do and speeds you drive. For instance: If you clear the trip meter then go a few weeks driving only to the store and near your home, you could easily show an average mpg well over 90 because you are using mostly the battery on short drives then recharging between them. When I drove daily for work on highways my average combined mpg always hovered around 64. On long trips to Santa Barbara that dropped to 54. And on trips to Phoenix setting the speed control to 85 mph the mpg dropped to about 45.  3. Love the hatch back and storage, very large and very handy, again larger than the Prius, mainly because even though it is the same foot print as the larger Prius model it sits over 6” taller, which gave me the head room I need but also taller storage pace so more stuff could fit in.  4. Surprisingly peppy and great handling.  5. Loved the induction breaks that teach you how to regain energy back into the battery by breaking a bit sooner and more gradually to get more electric range.  Now the things I did not like and fixed myself.  1. Three months after I purchased it was driving and hear something dragging like it was stuck under my car. Pulled over saw a large plastic piece under my car that broke loose. Went to the dealer to have it fixed under the warrantee but was told I had an accident and had to pay for the fix. ACCIDENT???? What accident, if I had been in an accident I think I would have remembered that. The dealer went on to tell me that I probably drove over the top of one of those tire stops at all parking lots and the tire stop tore this piece loose. I tried to reason telling him that those tire stops were for tires to bump into, he countered by saying I needed to stop short of them. I paid for the repair, a few hundred dollars but was not happy. When I noticed that same plastic shroud coming loose a few months later I got under the car myself and saw the problem and fixed it. That was over 6 years ago now and it is fine with no problems. You may want to know what the fix was? That plastic shroud was held up by 8 plastic clips. I simply replaced the plastic clips with metal bolts and washers, and no more problem. The shroud was not the problem the freaking cheap plastic clips were. $3.00 solution.  2. The rear lift gate from the get go had a problem sticking and being hard to open. Took it back to the dealer many times with them saying it was a simple adjustment, then within weeks it would happen again. Finally gave up on them. Then one day the lift gate handle actually came off the car in my hand as I lifted up to open it. The handle lifted up but the door stayed closed. Went back to the dealer who informed me that Ford considers door handles accessories and accessories are not covered under the extended warrantee I had purchased. Now you are beginning to understand why I am not fond of Ford. They wanted almost $500 to fix it. I told them to shove it and fixed it myself with epoxy, reattaching the original handle. That was over 5 years ago, and still holding well. Again the original was attached with plastic clips. I also figured out a fix for the sticky lift gate. The fix is knowing a simple trick. When you first squeeze the lever to unlock, instead of pulling up, lightly push down. You will hear a click and the door opens almost by itself. Something the dealer never told me or may even know.  3. The last really annoying thing I fixed was an electrical issue. This vehicle for the entire time I have owned it, almost 7 years now, has this issue of once or twice a year the electronics, radio and dash lights get stuck on. They simply can not be turned off. You can lock the doors, come back and use the car, but the radio and dash stays on and you can not use your phone or change stations or modes. The dealer did fix it for free and I watched them fix it. I was told there was a glitch in the electronics that required a complete reset of the electronic system and the only way to do that was to disconnect the 12v battery in the rear of the car for about 10 seconds. A lot like the simple fix for computers. Just turn off the power and let it reboot. For over a year I carried around a ratchet set needed to get into the space to disconnect the ground wire for the battery. Then realized all I needed to do was put in a different bolt that has a thumb screw head instead of needing a ratchet. So the problem still exists, but the fix is much easier and requires no tools.  4. This thing seems to be a common problem with other mfg vehicles too, since I have friends with other makes like BMW and Chevy that have very similar issues. The car does connect to my phone easily and make and receives calls well , but most of the other phone connection issues and functions like GPS are not good. So as you can see in the pics I have a magnetic phone mount conveniently located so I can use my phones GPS easily.  5. Also near that phone mount you will see I put a USB charger into the 12v hole that should have been a usb charger in the first place.  Lastly, items included in the sale and options  Also included in the sale are the magnetic connectors for your phone to connect to the mount and a spare tire. I buy my tires at Costco and the ones on this car are still under warrantee which should pass on to you, paper work included with the sale. The reason I keep a spare tire is simple. Costco does not stock this tire. It can take 2 days to a week to get sometimes, so for emergencies like tire punctures that can not be fixed I got in the habit early on of always keeping the best tire of an old set as a spare just in case I needed something fast while waiting for a replacement. Costco has been great about this.  This vehicles battery is so small that you could easily charge over night with just the factory included charging cord but if you need to charge it quickly in a couple hours during the day I do have a Bosch Power Max wall charger I could sell you for $500. You would need an electrician to install it, and I do happen to know a good one for San Diego area buyers.  That's about it. Hope all this info was helpful, and I can sell you my car or help you get a discount on a Tesla. Happy to answer any of your questions\n",

      "Description The 1967 Ranchero used the basic 1966 Ranchero body with Fairlane trim, front sheet metal, and interior treatments instead of Falcon. It was marketed as the Fairlane Ranchero. This was a well-received and unique one-year vehicle, with clean, straight lines, dual stacked headlamps, and plenty of power; the Ranchero had entered the muscle car arena in 1967. Engine options started with a 200�cu�in� straight-6 and went up to a 390�cu�in� FE-series big-block V8 giving 315�bhp� and backed by an optional C6 automatic, the new-for-1966 heavy duty variant of the C4. 1967 also saw the largest expansion of trim levels since the vehicle's introduction ten years prior.

This is about the time when you're saying it is too good to be true, and let us be the one's to tell you, it is absolutely true. More information about the 2017 Ford F-150: The F-150 might be the most important vehicle made by Ford. It continues to be one of their top-selling vehicles, encouraging Ford to put their best foot forward with the 2017 model. The F-150 competes with the Ram, the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra 1500, among others, in the full-sized truck category. Ford is clearly pushing its new technology and new ideas with the F-150, offering plenty of options not available anywhere else in this class, such as a 360-degree camera and integrated loading ramps stowed in the pickup bed. A smaller, more fuel efficient EcoBoost engine is also available, which should further improve fuel economy while providing the same kind of horsepower that would normally be delivered by mid-grade V8 engines. At the same time, the F-150 continues to excel at traditional truck tasks, with a best in class towing capacity of 12,200 pounds when properly equipped. Interesting features of this model are rugged durability, efficient turbocharged engines, improved gas mileage, Towing capacity, and available in a huge variety of trimsVehicle InfoStock #: L3823VIN: 1FTEX1CF3HFA99591Condition: UsedOdometer: 53228DrivetrainTransmission Type: AutomaticDrivetrain: Rear Wheel DriveBody & InteriorExterior Color: WHI/WhiteOEM Color Name: WHI/WhiteDoors: 42017 FORD F-150 XL Call Frankie Estrada at (512) 456-9425 ext 70or text 70 to (512) 456-9425 for full details http://17270.cleancarsorg.com/l/42923875/2/21999846/70 $26,998\n",

      "Description Because it is not currently being used, I am selling my 2005 Dodge Sprinter 3500. By far the best cargo vehicle that I ever had, the engine has 430.000 miles and still runs like new, great mileage per gallon, not a single leak, A/C Works, great vehicle for deliveries, all the mileages were on highway, two handtrucks included.  The only thing is that the transmission needs work, it only has one speed going forward and reverse (probably a sensor), it also needs a belt replacement, some minor cosmetics dents. Due to covid 19, I don't have the money to make this repairs so I need to sell it fast, the price is negotiable within reason.\n",

Impressive fuel economy on the hybrid model comes without the hybrid model premium markup. Source: KBB.com* Eye-catching design; high fuel economy from available hybrid model; many standard features. Source: Edmunds* The 2014 Lincoln MKZ is simply breathtaking from front to back. Its classic split-wing grille and beautiful flowing curves, inspired by a waterfall, are merely an indication of its unique inner workings. If fewer fill-ups appeals to you, choose the standard 2.0L EcoBoost I-4 turbocharged direct-injection engine. It offers up to 33 mpg hwy with 240 hp and 270 lb.-ft. of torque - the performance you would expect from a 6-cylinder (FWD: 22 mpg city/33 hwy. - AWD: 22 mpg city/31 hwy). For more of a rush, opt for the 3.7L Ti-VCT 24-valve aluminum V6. It increases output to 300 hp and 277 lb.-ft. of torque, and still offers impressive economy, thanks in part to shutters in the front grille that automatically close at speed to help you slip through the air with less resistance (FWD: 19 mpg city and 28 hwy. - AWD: 18 mpg city and 26 hwy). The Lincoln MKZ also provides a Hybrid option, which gets 38 mpg city and 37 hwy. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid uses a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery for more power and less weight. In electric mode, it can run up to 62 mph. The 2.0L Atkinson-cycle I-4 engine and electric traction motor recharge the battery while you drive. New for 2014, Lincoln has added daytime running lights to many of the optional packages. The open spaciousness of Lincoln MKZ is a result of what is not there. For instance: no traditional shifter. Lincoln eliminated the intrusive knob to create a thin center console that flows gracefully through the cabin. Step back and soak in the stunning, floating dual-arch design, inspired by the shape of a calla lily. Lift your eyes to the instrument panel, and you will recognize the rhythmic symmetry of a manta ray. Lincoln eschewed conventional design in interior lighting as well. Illuminated front-door sill plates welcome you. Inside, rear passengers 'swipe' dots of light on the ceiling to activate their reading lamps. Even the door locks are subtle, emitting a red LED glow when locked. Source: The Manufacturer Summary22/31 City/Highway MPGBuy With Confidence at Tamiami Hyundai In Beautiful Naples Florida.

      "Description For sale is my Infiniti Q50S Red Sport in very good condition. I purchased this car in 2018 and it has exceeded my expectation. With 400HP and 350lbft of torque there is more than enough power on demand. Directly competes with the C43 AMG and BMW 340i but way more reliable. Bought a new vehicle with more room for family so this unfortunately must go. It is an amazing sport sedan and with 33+k miles almost new. The motor and transmission are excellent. This is the all wheel drive model with the optional steer by wire system. This is a 2016 model but has a significant number of upgrades to the 2018 look. The dash with stitched patterns, steering, shift knob, front and rear lights, front and rear bumpers. It looks amazing and sporty! You won't find another 2016 that looks this good. I have put about 13k miles on this car with no issues at all. Miles might increase as I still drive the car once in a while.\n",

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.  Automotive Experience Richard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.  What Do We Sell? The automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.  How do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South? As a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.  What Sets Us Apart From the Others? From the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.  We are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.

You can also lower all 4 windows only (no middle bar) for a very open, breezy drive.  4 driving modes up to Sport Plus. Apple Carplay compatible and need I tell you how seamless BMW interiors are?

Very special edition and color scheme. 1,540 miles, (that’s not a typo). 6 speed manual, navigation, turbo, easy to use convertible top. It’s a blast to drive, especially in sport mode.  Brembo brakes, stereo speakers in headrest.   It’s always been garaged and covered, and with hardly any miles it is in brand new condition. One owner, clear title. I’m looking for a newer Jeep and need to thin the herd. I have had this for over a year and only put 1,540 miles.  It would be difficult to find one this color scheme and condition.

      "Description Selling a weird one. This is a 1973 International Bus which has been converted into a ramped car hauler.   Key details:  THE GOOD - 1973 International with 1989 body pieces swapped in. Titled as a 1973. - 9.0L 555ci L10 diesel motor. Approx. 139k miles. Runs extremely smooth without any major leaks. - Allison transmission. Cannot remember the model, but it's an auto. Shifts fine. - Stops fine. Brakes are good. - Has cruise control. - Custom aluminum raised roof.  - Tires are in good shape, reasonably new. - Batteries are around 5 years old. - Entire backside of bus folds down into a ramp for loading. The interior opening is 96\" wide. Manual hand-crank winch. We fit and hauled a WJ Grand Cherokee in the back with no issues. - Includes a wood stove (pictured) which we had planned to use for heating.  - Includes a bunch of extra fuel, trans, and oil filters. - Of the seats shown in the interior, the forward-facing seats have been removed. - Built-in fairlead for loading/unloading of non-running vehicles. - Anchor points built into the floor. - Plumbed for air to the rear off of engine compressor. - Now painted gloss black with tractor paint from TSC.  - Titled under 18k pounds as an RV/van, no CDL required. Clean title in hand.  THE BAD - Radiator was very old and developed a significant leak after sitting for a few months. We pulled the radiator (pictured) and have not had a chance to replace it. The radiator also has an integrated transmission cooler. For the time being we have a bypass hose run for the cooler so the bus can run/drive/stop, but cannot be driven long distances.  The radiator can be found on Amazon/eBay for $700-900.  The install job is simple, but we have not had time/funds to order a replacement. The bus DID NOT overheat and never has. I can share the Amazon listing if you are interested.   I drove this 10 hours through a snowstorm to get it home several years ago, without issue. It took several subsequent trips from MD to the PA mountains hauling Jeeps, also without any issues. It is loud and not terribly fast, but is a strong runner and turns heads. Fun project if you have the space. We had grand plans for this but ran out of time. Located in central MD.   Myself and the property owner of where it currently sits would prefer if they buyer could come tow the bus away, rather than fix it where it sits. I am happy to negotiate on price to help you with towing costs. Serious inquiries only, please. Don't contact me unless you have the space. Email me first to request phone number, then we can talk/text further. Thanks!  - Adam\n",

I have a front clip for it arriving Sept 8-11, with all parts needed to finish the repairs. No frame damage and has good air bags. Damage is all bolt on parts. Just need to paint and install. I have replaced the intake manifold. Runs and drives excellent, super clean. Buy this, do the repairs and have an almost new vehicle at a fraction of the price of new!

      "Description ***Bidding update as of 8/17/2020. Next available bid is $5,500. There is a chance I will close bidding at the expiration of this craigslist post depending on interest level (instead of waiting another month). Bids increase in $500 increments. Vehicle will be sold. This is the lowest mileage you will see on this vintage of vehicle for a long time.***  1986 Toyota Truck. 2 Wheel Drive. 4 Speed Manual. All original. 2 Owner. 22R engine. It only has 53, 500 miles (this is not a typo). The odometer still has a 0 in the hundred thousand mile column. No leaks or any problems with this vehicle. Nameplate states that vehicle was made in Japan.  I accidentally inherited this vehicle last week. It was previously owned by my grandpa who absolutely pampered this vehicle since he bought it in the early 1990's in Billings. It is the most lightly driven Toyota pick-up you will ever find. I just drove it up and down Reserve Street today in Missoula and it drove like a champ in 4 lanes of traffic. I really like this truck, but my garage is already full and this truck is too nice for its age to park on the street. This truck has no leaks or mechanical problems that I could find.  I will be taking bids for this truck over the next 3 months. Highest bid gets the truck. Do your research on-line. Some people are buying this exact same vehicle for the same price with 200,000 miles on it. This vehicle only has 53,000 miles on it and is completely original. It starts right up and can be driven right to your door. You could drive it on the interstate if you wanted to.  Here is a link referencing this truck (mine doesn't have the optional turbo): https://jalopnik.com/i-just-bought-this-turbo-1986-toyota-pickup-sight-unsee-1823377519  If you would like to place a bid on this vehicle, please give me a call at: For-0-Six 4-tree-8 3124  If you are local I would like to meet you in person to know that you are serious about your bid. Highest bid after 3 months gets the truck. Will be sold. Also, a mint copy of the original 1985 Montana travel map provided with the vehicle when it was originally sold will also be included with the vehicle free of charge.\n",

      "Description 1973 Triumph TR6. French Blue w/Black interior. Solid, rust free body, not a bit of bondo on any of it. Paint is nice but it’s not show car quality, this is a very nice looking driver. The interior, on the other hand, is very much show car quality. Seats, seat foam, seat suspension rubbers, carpets, door panels, door tops, all the dashboard pieces, every bit of it was done with new, high quality parts. All dashboard lights work, flashers, wipers, everything. The entire wiring harness was replaced, front to rear. Gauges all work and look very nice. New windshield, new roll-up side window channels and parts. Convertible top is old and could stand to be replaced, but the back window is clear, and it does the job of keeping the weather out when you need it.  Brakes are not new but work well. New master cylinder. The car was converted to Koni shock absorbers all around, using the better quality kit with the heavy duty rear mounts. Tires are old and should be replaced.  New aluminum gas tank. Freshly rebuilt transmission from Quantum Mechanics in Connecticut. New clutch master cylinder, slave cylinder, and ‘Magic Clutch’ kit (pressure plate, bearing, clutch disc) from Roadster Factory.  Freshly rebuilt engine, built by Bloss Machine, with Good Parts GP2 Camshaft. Beautiful Hitachi SU carburetor conversion from Paltec. Carbs could use a little more fine tuning, but engine runs good and pulls strong. Lots of torquey power with this cam/carb setup.  New alternator, new high torque starter motor, new battery, new radiator and water pump. Petronix ignition. New exhaust system. Lots of new rubber parts. Lots of other new parts — too much to list.   This is priced to sell. Need it gone before winter. $15,900 or make me an offer.\n",

      "Description Beautiful, rare 1978 Pontiac Skybird Esprit - 24,100 miles – 305 – automatic transmission. Rust-free. Excellent body and paint. PS, PB, AC, Cruise, AM, NEW BATTERY.  I am the 2nd owner. The Skybird was sold on 9-4-78 by Schoon Motors of Luverne, MN. (SW MN near Sioux Falls, SD.) Owner #1 moved to Yankton, SD in the 80s, later returning to the Luverne area. On March 30, 2018, Owner # 1 traded the Skybird on another vehicle at Sampson Corvettes of Sanborn, Iowa. Mileage at that time was 23,661 miles The title was transferred to Schroeder Motors of St. Charles, Missouri on May 4. Mileage was 23,665. Schroeder Motors sent the car to the Mecum Auction in Harrisburg, PA in July, 2018. I purchased the car on August 4, 2018 Mecum required my son, who was acting as my agent, to license it in his name. A Mecum transport delivered it to Minnesota. It is licensed as a collector car. Except for dealers, I and owners # 1 have been the only owners. The car has 24,100 miles, and it is in great condition inside and out. I had a lube job done immediately. Unfortunately, the air conditioning clutch and compressor were defective, so I had them replaced by my Pontiac dealer. I have the receipts. I also have insurance and yearly DMV receipts that verify the location and mileage. My wife and I once owned an exact duplicate of this car, and we really enjoyed it, which is why we decided to buy it. However, we have developed health issues - I’m 87 - so it is time to sell. This car has not seen rain or snow while I have owned it. The body is excellent, and the paint is apparently original. It starts and runs beautifully and quietly. It is a pleasure to drive, and it gets good mileage. It has the original spare tire - never used. I can supply more photos. I have the original bill of sale - and even the original build sheet from the factory plus a lot of of other documents. Delivery is possible, depending upon distance and arrangements.

How do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South? As a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups.

      "Description For sale I have a 1968 Pontiac Tempest. It is a Pontiac 350 with a two speed column shifted automatic. It runs and drive well other than the transmission leaking out of the speedometer cable hole. I am going to try and find time to replace it before it sells. The car is rust free, but mostly bondo from the previous owner it seems well done.Since I’ve owned it I’ve put Wilwood front disc brakes on and replaced the rear drums and shoes. I also replaced the booster, master cylinder and brakes lines. It is a solid foundation for a great project car.  Needs/Issues: -front and intermediated parking brake cables -front and rear seat belts -needs tires -needs exhaust  - new light sockets front and rear (also missing front parking light housing and lamps) - hood and driver side door Need realignment , guessing from when previous owner worked on car. -trans needs vacuum modulator hooked back up, I don’t know of any internal issues it seems to shift okay. - I noticed when I was replacing the rear drum brakes that the axle shafts have excessive end play  Hoping to get $8000 but will consider all reasonable offers and trades. I will only trade for GM A and F bodies, early Mustangs, or early Mopars, or late model V8  stick shift muscle cars. So don’t waste my time offering something that isn’t that.\n",

In 1891, Auguste Doriot Hobe and his Peugeot colleague / Louis Ochopee Rigoulot completed Naples the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Lauderhill Type 3 completed 2,100 km Olympia (1,300 miles) from Valentigney South Moore to Paris and Brest and back again. They Mileage Palmetto were attached to the first ParisBrestParis bicycle race, but River finished 6 days after the winning Flamingo cheap, cyclist, Charles White Heights Terront.nThe Quarters Plantation first design Springs Groves for an American / car with FACTORY, a gasoline Pick internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent Wellington for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of / sixteen Fort years Palm and a series of attachments / to his application, truck, on Exterior 5 November Davie 1895, Selden was granted a United Aventura States Lantana patent (U.S. Patent Saint 549,160) for a two-stroke van, car 0, Group engine, which hindered, more Parkland than encouraged, development of cars in the United El States. His / 4WD patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered Indian American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea Fort brothers Palm of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first Islamorada Like public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon lease, took place Sale on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield. The Studebaker Automobile Company, subsidiary Deals of a long-established Hypoluxo Palm wagon Glenvar and coach manufacturer, started FUEL to build cars in 1897 and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 Cypress and 2003 gasoline vehicles in 1904.nIn Britain, there had been / several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees 2008 of success, with affordable Thomas Tequesta Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860. Santler FLEXIBLE from Malvern is recognized by Mileage the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having Beach Glen made the first gasoline-powered Mal Bad car COUPE, in the country in 1894, West followed Manors by Frederick William Park / Palm Gardens Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs. The first New production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler 4 Company, North a company Key founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after fair purchasing the South right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its REBATES, first car in 1897, and they All bore 2000 the name Daimler.nIn 1892, German engineer Palm Rudolf Diesel was Sale Village granted Cornwell a patent for a \"New Rational Combustion Jupiter Engine\". In 1897, he built Lakes the first diesel engine. Steam-, Miami electric-, and gasoline-powered Golden time vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal City combustion Lithia engines achieving dominance BHPH,financing, Like in reliable Miami the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with Mile the conventional piston and Lake crankshaft design, only Coral Mazda's Virginia version of the Wankel engine has had 1991 more than very Shores Pioneer limited Park wheel success.nAll in all, Espanol it no, is estimated Beach that over 100,000 patents BEACON, created the modern automobile and motorcycle.nnnMass Seats Pickup / productionnnLarge-scale, AWD FUEL production-line Clarke manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom credit, Olds in Margate 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly CREDIT, Auto Motor line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Fort Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of Sale mass production and interchangeable Ridge Breezes parts had been Deal pioneered Import in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, / Massachusetts. This concept Springs was greatly expanded Sign / by Henry Ford, Rio beginning Myers in www.selectivemotorcar.com, Island 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line trucks, for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.nAs a result, Ford's cars came off the Doors, line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity / eightfold, while using Beach less manpower (from 12.5-man-hours to / 1 hour credit 33 minutes). It Jensen Like was so successful, owned Cheap Motor / paint became a Clean bottleneck. Only Japan Black 2018 would dry fast enough, COLORS, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors BHPH, available before 1913, until fast-drying Lake Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, Loan \"any color as long as it's black\". In 1914, an Beach assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.nFord's complex Wheels safety proceduresespecially assigning each buyer worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam Buckhead aboutdramatically all reduced the rate of injury. New The combination Gate of high wages and high efficiency is called \"Fordism,\" New and was copied ITIN by most major / Bad industries. Belle 1999 The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided Application with the economic rise of the United Sonic States. The assembly line forced workers to Seating work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain Now in 1911, / Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany time, 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies Instant had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; 4dr by 1930, 250 companies cheap which did not, had disappeared.nDevelopment of automotive use, technology was Loans / rapid, due in part DOWN, to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included / electric ignition and the electric self-starter Loan COUPE, Financing Sport (both Check by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 19101911), independent suspension, Seats and four-wheel brakes.nSince the Miles 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, Bankruptcy so marketing plans often have heavily 2005 influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different / makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move Cheap up\" as their fortunes improved.nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume 2009 resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with 2020 interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) 1995 were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, First could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only  17 of those were left.nIn Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice 1994 of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% *Monthly payment based on 15% Down for 60 months at 5.9% APR financing On Approved Credit.

How to protect your purchase? CARFAX BuyBack Guarantee got you covered. You appreciate the finer things in life, the vehicle you drive should not be the exception. Style, performance, sophistication is in a class of its own with this stunning BMW i3 . This vehicle has extremely low mileage on the odometer, so while it's pre-owned, it's practically new. This vehicle comes with a navigation system. That doesn't mean you won't get lost. But it does mean you won't stay lost. More information about the 2015 BMW i3: The BMW i3 is part of the new wave of electric and hybrid cars that are becoming more and more popular in the U.S. The i3 has relatively compact external dimensions, but still has a very usable cabin with surprising amounts of interior space. Standard equipment levels are high and the i3 generally aims to compete in the compact premium segment, offering buyers plenty of luxury features in a car that is perhaps a little smaller than the traditional luxury cars of old. Of course, the electric drivetrain is what really separates the i3 from its competitors. In standard form, it offers a combination of usable range and remarkably fast charging times. With the optional range extender equipped, the system offers functionality similar to other hybrid cars on the market such as the Chevrolet Volt- the i3 uses its range extending gasoline engine exclusively as a generator, providing electric power to the rear wheel motors. The i3 base price starts at under $43,000, while versions equipped with a range extender start at around $46,000. Interesting features of this model are efficient usage of space, good driving dynamics, full of cutting-edge technology, electric drivetrain, and Small footprint Thank you for visiting another one of Toyota of Buena Parks exclusive listings!

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tAccessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

      "Description $4200 OBO - Brand New Warrantied Motor!! 1988 Ford E-350 5.8l with 25,000 original miles!!   My girlfriend and I are offering an incredible deal on our mostly restored, partially converted school bus with a brand new motor! We have put over 2 years of hard work into this vehicle and almost $8,000 to get it 95% of the way to being a fully restored vehicle for a home on wheels. However, we recently found a bigger and better vehicle that better suits our needs, at a price we couldn't refuse. So, we have decided to pass this bus on to somebody at a price they can't refuse!   This vehicle has a few problems that still need to be addressed but it does run and drive. Aside from the paint job, it's in great shape - especially for its age. All work is professional grade and all receipts and paperwork are available. Clean restored (notarized) title in hand and we are willing to deliver near Flagstaff if needed.  2 wheel drive 1 ton van. C6 automatic transmission. stripped/sealed school bus body. Restored Salvage Title. Stripped interior dimensions 13’ 6” long to back of driver's seat, 7’6” Wide, 6’ ½” Tall It is large enough that our floor plan would accommodate a queen bed sideways in the rear of the bus, along with a shower, toilet, couch that converts to a bed, and a surprisingly large kitchen. This vehicle is also very easy and cheap to ensure and cheap to register due to the GVWR being 8000 lbs or lower.  The Good -25,000 Original miles!!! -Frame has very little surface rust -New remanufactured motor professionally installed with about 250 miles on it. (Still in break-in period, replaced due to age) -New motor is still covered under a 3 year/unlimited mileage warranty for about 2 more years -Decent gas mileage for the size at around 8.5 MPG -Every single engine component has been replaced including     ---Motor mounts     ---Exhaust manifolds     ---All sensors and senders     ---All relays and switches     ---All hoses, tubes and gaskets     ---Ground wires     ---Alternator - 75 amp     ---Emission system/pump     ---Fan clutch and water pump     ---Radiator and heater core     ---Injectors, plugs, wires and distributor     ---Battery     ---Engine ECU/Computer     ---Fuel pumps ***The only components not replaced are: the engine wiring harness, the power steering pump, the starter, and the brake booster, as none of them needed replacement*** -Engine bay cleaned, painted, and re-insulated with heat- and sound-insulating wrap. -New brakes and brake lines all around -Tires are older but have 80% tread and no cracking. They have also been verified safe. -New windshield   -Refinished roof with Henry's Tropicool Sealant that reflects sunlight and heat very well. -Old windows removed and replaced with large sliding RV windows with screens, mounted in custom fabricated steel frames, with custom sheet metal. -Whole bus body is sealed (except for the rear hatch, but we will include the required weather stripping) -Ceiling height will accommodate anybody up to 6 feet tall -Front door height increased as well as overall door raise to allow for high clearance -Very high clearance! -Custom fabricated front door with temporary plexiglass window (we intended to switch it out with safety glass after construction) -Side skirts are chopped to make room for underbody storage -New roof-mounted marker/running lights -Interior is fully stripped and ready for construction. -Refinished driver/cabin floor -We have receipts and paperwork for every single thing that has gone into this project. -We will also include things like a full rebuild manual, complete wiring diagrams, all original parts (to access part numbers), heat- and sound-insulating wrap, oil & filter for 500 mile oil change as part of break-in procedure, and most of the gallon of paint that we started to use on the exterior of the bus.   The Bad -Engine has trouble idling until warmed up -Computer has codes for a lean condition as well as MAP sensor out of test range. The check engine light will intermittently turn on and off. -Slight power loss that only becomes apparent when climbing hills on the highway -Transmission kickdown cable needs to be adjusted. It likes to keep you in second gear so I have just had it disconnected. Also, if you need to pass quickly on the highway, you can manually shift down a gear. -Needs new catalytic converter after engine has completed break-in period (first 500 miles). Universal catalytic converters can be found cheaply online or original equipment for only a bit more. -Fuel gauge does not work (easy fix, either the sender or the gauge itself) -Does not have A/C. It is capable but it does not have the system installed -Dash Heater/AC switch wiring needs minor repair and vac lines reconnected to air distribution box. -Exhaust system doesn't have heat shields - until some are installed or a subfloor is installed, the floor gets hot while driving. Universal heat shields can be found cheaply online.  This bus is small and versatile enough that it can fit into one parking space, yet big enough that it can accommodate any design you can imagine. It can take dirt roads, steep driveways and narrow tracks. It is the prime adventure vehicle, waiting for the right person or people to build it out!   If you feel the call of adventure, need the freedom, or want to be a weekend warrior, come check out this beautiful chance to have a rolling, free-moving home!   My name is Ben.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tAccessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

      "Description 2015 Dodge Dart with extremely low 37k miles.  The car was involved in a front end collision, it has not been fixed and will be sold as-is.  You are going to need to do bodywork on the front bumper and hood, replace the driver side headlight, and replace the turbo as it was damaged and removed from the engine, I still have the old parts as some of them may be salvageable.   This car still holds a clean title, and a Carfax will be provided to buyer.  The vehicle was purchased as part of a mechanic shop foreclosure in Virginia, I have all the paperwork to legally sell it and get title here in Georgia.  The paperwork filed was for an abandoned vehicle with Virginia DMV.   Car Does Not Run as it sits, the turbo is off the car, you can’t crank it to start.   Please be aware this is a $10k car priced at just $3,500 as it still needs repairs, so bring cash and a trailer or tow dolly to purchase it. Thanks\n",

      "Description As the title says, it's a true barn find.  I drove it into the barn 19 years ago, and it hasn't been started or driven since.  Barn was sold so I winched it onto a trailer where it is now.  26,000 actual miles, one owner.  It's dirty from sitting all those years, needs a bath.  Interior is in excellent condition.  Body does have some rust, not extreme.  Very straight, not one dent anywhere.  Needs both bumpers replaced.  Have not attempted to start it.  And would not until oil and filter is changed, and preferrably, coolant flush and trans fluid and filter change, that's just common sense and good mainenance for longevity of this extremely low mileage car.  Asking $ 4,500, but willing to discuss SERIOUS cash offers.\n",

No idea why ABS is on but assume it’s related to the brakes. - It’s got a really nice leather interior but there is a small tare on the drivers side seat so I put a seat cover on - Passenger side seat slide back is broken.  - The convertible roof goes down smoothly\n",

Here's something completely different... A Chevy 3500 Express Van with only 42k miles!!! If that's not enough...how about a built in Cummins generator! Even more crazy... An actual X-ray machine!!! Ok, these vans were typically used at check points at borders and such to do X-rays on people or packages!!! Has a couple of awnings that fold out to help keep the sun off your back. Has a few different plugins on the sides of the van for different applications. Not sure what all to say about the X-ray equipment as I have no idea on how to even turn it on! We figured most people would just take all the equipment out and keep the generator in and use it as a work vehicle. Would be great for a contractor, painter, electrician, plumber ect...!

      "Description This is a 2012 Ram 4500 utility body bucket truck diesel that needs some repair to the wiring in the boom.  There was a minor battery fire in the bed behind the bucket mount.  There seems to be no major damage but wiring will need checking and of course some new batteries in the bed.  There is a Honda generator mounted on the bed and the rest of the body is good.  The chassis is 4500 with the 6.7 diesel with only 111241 miles.  Mechanically the truck is excellent.  It runs and drives well and is ready for work with the repair.  The ETI body and bucket are high quality and expensive.  The truck was purchased from an insurance company and had a salvage title.  It has been inspected by the Highway Patrol and has a rebuilt title suitable for road use.  This is a great truck that needs a little tlc in the electrical area.

      "Description 1976 MG Midget.  Excellent condition.  No rust or body filler anywhere.  Electronic ignition installed along with an electric radiator cooling fan.  Electric fuel pump installed.  All original interior.  I purchased this vehicle in 2009 when it was completely disassembled.  The previous owner took it to a professional restorer to have it completely done.  The costs escalated so the owner brought all the pieces back to put it together himself.  Did not have the time (or ability) so I put them all together.  The engine was rebuilt and now has only 3,000 miles on it.  Car was painted English Racing Green.  Very good paint job.  4 Speed manual transmission. The car was undercoated when first purchased.  I believe this is why there is no rust on the body.  Lots of little extras on this car.  Clean title in hand.  Miss extra parts included.  Fun little car to drive.  DO NOT TEXT ME.  I WILL ONLY RESPOND TO PHONE CALLS.  Too many scammers out there.\n",

      "Description I got this when I was 15 years old that was 1972! I had a stroke last year, i was 62.  I’ve got her sister a67 Chevy long bed with a 283 that I’ve built and I just now got resurrected! It’s for sale as well as this one ! I Visit Her every Easter at my brothers ranch ! However it’s been sitting since I put her there! Like I said I had a stroke I’m never gonna be able to Fix Her Up Properly ! Body is in good condition , there’s no rust through holes that I’ve seen ! Ahhh it’s got like a quarter inch steel bed on the bed flooring liner , step side ! So the dash is nice and pretty , has the fold out windows , the granny transmission I was going to use. The bumpers are there somebody stole the grill & the headlights of course ! steering wheel still there , it’s got a little side toolbox on the running board , tailgate bumpers it still has , a rear tail light is only required one back then ! I’ve had many ideas of what type of engine , but I built the 283 and Board it out to 327 with power pack heads , steel crank ,Rods, Mickey Thompson 12 to 1 and I was going to Bolt it up to Original transmission ￼. I rode her in there all the tires aired up ,she Steered Well & Rolled Well ! Ahhh that’s where I stopped her ! So that was only about 20 years ago, when I moved her from my house. I think it’s a good deal !Oo , it’s got that kind of paint weathering where I would clearcoat Her ! So , I Saw that new design of just clearcoating ! Patena is Great for that ! I thought that looked pretty chill I saw a couple of them done well ! I’m gonna get better pictures I hope, because it’s a prime candidate for that. ￼￼￼￼\n",

      "Description If you are looking for a great low mileage truck, at a fraction of the cost of a new truck, then look no further.  This hard to find \"LTZ Plus\" 2013 Silverado 1500 Z71 4X4 crew cab not only looks like new, it drives like new and handles like new. It literally has no signs underneath, of ever having been driven off-road.  It is literally the best truck I have ever owned, and may very well be the finest used truck, in the North, available for sale. When I was a teenager, many years ago, we would have described this truck as a \"cream puff.\"  It was a one-owner, local area, new truck trade-in, when I purchased it 6 months ago, from a nearby GM dealership.  As you can see from the photos, it is absolutely gorgeous. The deluxe black metallic exterior, and the deluxe black leather interior, with lots of chrome and stainless steel.  gives the truck an eye-turning appearance.  Some of the many truck features are: LTZ PLUS top-of-the-line Model; LTZ PLUS Premium Trim Package; LTZ PLUS top-of-the-line Interior Package; Z71 heavy duty towing package w/ Tow Haul lever; Z71 4X4 heavy duty Suspension Package; Premium 14-way Power Seats; Tilt/telescoping, leather-wrapped steering wheel; lane change warning sensors; Deep Tint windows; BOSE top-of-the-line Premium Sound System; WeatherTec Carpet Mats; Tinted WeatherTec window visors and tinted Weather Tec Bug Deflector; deluxe Side Running Boards; back-up Camera; Adjustable Pedals; etc. etc. etc. Too many to list here. This is the very top model, so it has just about everything.\n",

      "Description Very clean base model with quick charge package and all-weather floor mats Gun Metallic Grey Backup Camera 30kWh battery with 107 mile range battery is still under 8 year / 100,000 mile warranty tires are in good shape and have only 7k miles on them battery inspection reports have all been excellent, including inspection on 9/12/2020  I bought this car new in 2017.  I have had no problems with this car, it is a pleasure to drive, and it is inexpensive to charge and maintain.  I generally did not drive it in the snow or on dirt roads or when the roads were salty, so it is very clean, the paint and the windshield are unscratched, and the interior is like new.  I am selling it because I don't drive enough to justify keeping it.  I have only been driving it 5k miles per year and foresee driving it less than that in the next couple of years.  I would like to see it go to someone who will replace more combustion-based driving with it than I likely will.\n",

      "Description We have up for sale a 2012 Dodge Sprinter (made by Freightliner) 2500 van. It comes equipped with a 6-cylinder Mercedes diesel engine, paired with a Mercedes automatic transmission. It is very light grey with grey cloth interior, cold air conditioning and AM/FM/CD stereo system. It has low miles for the year model with only 123,000. It runs out great with absolutely no problems. It has a brand new set of matching Michelin tires and a new NC inspection. With all that being said, the body does lack a little bit of luster however. The previous owner apparently wanted the paint to be flat and sprayed it with the light grey color described. It was originally white. They were also apparently going to turn it into a camper as people are renowned for as they had started with flooring and paneling as you can see in the photos. The rear air works, but the cover is missing. One can only assume they had taken it off to work on the interior. Auto Check says no accidents have been reported. From the looks of the van, that is correct. It hardly has a ding on it.  The van would also make an excellent work vehicle for someone in construction or delivery. We are asking $16,350 but may entertain very reasonable offers. For more information, please call at 33six-45two-eight41four. No texting please\n",

      "Description This is a Right-Hand Drive RHD Toyota HiAce Van Super Custom Limited Turbo Diesel. It has 97,750 miles or 157311 Kilometers, and is super clean and ready for a mail route! It was imported to Texas in 2019 and was used on a 7-mile mail route for about a year. During that time never had an issue at all and has been the best route vehicle I have ever had. I no longer work for the post office or I would never give this van up. It includes power locks and windows, dual-zone climate controls with cold A/C and heat, a digital dash, power steering system, auto lights and flashing lights for safety.  This van is finished in a two-tone White and gold with period graphics on the sides. Rain guards are mounted to both front windows (which help a lot in the rain) along with a parking mirror on the rear door.    The HiAce came standard with TEMS (Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension), which was first introduced in 1983 and features electronically-controlled shock absorbers. The TEMS prevents the van from tilting forward when stopping and makes for a very smooth ride. Four sunroofs are also equipped, with a significantly larger panoramic glass over the center occupants. The radio that is equipped works great with a FM receiver (included).  The 3.0L, 4 cylinder, SOHC, 2 valves per cylinder turbo diesel engine with indirect injection is mounted under the passenger seat and sends power to the rear wheels through an automatic transmission with overdrive (RWD). Maximum output is 130hp at 3600 rpm. The timing belt on this van was replaced at 71,547 Kilometers or 44,457miles. This van will cruise any Texas road or highway just fine. Still have all original paperwork and manuals.\n",

Our inventory is 99% commercial trucks which  are mainly municipality owned and a few hand picked privately owned vehicles. Since they are  work  trucks you \"might see\" scratches, dents, dings, decal imprefections, discolorations, scuff,  tears  etc. In some cases there will be broken locks, door handles, glovebox or missing keys, cracked  dashboard, non working radio and so on.

Here at MoreThanTrucks.com we always try to  service all our vehicles if they need to be!!! \" If Not Broken Don't Fix\" As a buyer it is more  important to buy a mechanically sound vehicle that is a good driver rather then worry about a  broken glovebox. Also most of our buyers have to drive the vehicle back home which is not around  the corner in most cases. When it comes to tires we hate to give an estimate so we photograph  all  tires so you see the tread thickness.

      "Description Used Toyota Corolla with very low mileage. Brand new battery, tires, and clean interior. Works like it’s brand new and comes with all of the papers. No accidents, most everything is original. The reason for the low mileage is due to the first owner only driving it once a week and the second owner driving it once a month. Willing to negotiate just message me for more details!!\n",

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tAccessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

      "Description This beautiful mopar has spent its entire life in the Gallatin Valley, always garaged and well cared for by the same family. In fact, every 1000 miles it was taken in for an oil change and lube! (Comes with the maintenance log book going back decades.) Regular waxings kept the paint in great shape, and the interior is in spectacular condition. The original owners were an older couple, so the back seat wasn't used, and for many years it was driven only by the widow. Her garage required her to climb in the passenger door, so ironically, the only wear on the front seat is on the right side. Other than a little wear on the carpet there also (see photo), the interior is a time capsule, as is the trunk - complete with original mat, spare, and tools.  The car comes with a 318 V8 that runs like a top, thanks no doubt to the fact that it's always benefited from fresh and clean oil. It provides plenty of power (220hp) and the automatic shifts perfectly. Needs nothing mechanically: great power brakes, power steering, front end, etc. Flies down the highway effortlessly. Good heater, wipers, lights, etc. Perfect glass and door seals, headliner, and door panels - not even a worn-out arm rest.  Outside the car rides on Toyo radials with plenty of tread left. The chrome bumpers have a mirror finish, and the paint has recently been touched up and buffed. There is a dent in the quarter panel on the right rear, which is clean enough of a crease that a trained bodyman (not me) could easily make it look a lot better. For some reason, that quarter panel also rusted at the bottom edge, but thankfully, it's a flat panel below the body line so it could be replaced without much metal fabrication. Other than that, there are two small rust spots as show in the photos.  The gas tank sending unit needs to be replaced for the gauge to work, and the horn worked recently and then stopped, not sure why. Other than that, the car needs nothing to begin enjoying immediately. This would be a great entry-level classic for someone, especially if they want to pile a ton of kids inside. Still, this is a modern car with safety features like seatbelts and the capability to keep up with traffic no problem, or take a trip without being restricted to the right lane.  Phone calls only please, and if you miss me please leave a message, since I get a lot of spam. If the ad is up it's still available, and I don't need any help selling it.\n",

More information about the 2015 Chevrolet Camaro: The Chevrolet Camaro is a modern take on GM's legendary muscle-car, offering strong rear-wheel-drive performance in a low coupe or convertible body style. Relative to the other pony cars like the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger, the Camaro performs athletically, although it gives up some outward visibility for the chunky, bold design. The performance standout of the model line remains the Camaro SS Coupe. Camaro Convertibles are a strong value as well and provide a different sort of fun. Some drivers wanting performance approaching that of high-end exotics, will be tempted by the ZL1 which provides outrageous horsepower numbers. While pricy among Camaros, it's faster than cars costing two or three times as much. This model sets itself apart with muscle-car look and feel, Strong acceleration, good highway efficiency, great handling, and daring design inside and out All efficacy claims & statements are relevant when disinfectant product is applied correctly.

Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCan I really secure financing with zero down payment?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMany customers actually take delivery \t\t\t \t\t\twithout a checkbook or credit card.\t\t\t \t\t\t While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Do you take trade-ins?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes.\t\t\t \t\t\t We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is another very common situation that usually \t\t\t \t\t\t won't \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them \"don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me\". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCOPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask \"Where might I see this vehicle?\". Someone will respond promptly.\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes. We have very simple process for this very common situation.

      "Description 1953 Pontiac sedan delivery. Sits on a 1979 Nova subframe. Oldsmobile Rocket 350. Automatic transmission. Heater A/C unit that I never hooked up AC. Electric wipers. Fender Skirts. Power Steering and power disc brakes in the front. It has electronic ignition.  I used this as a service truck and then in 2005 I had the body work done and painted, and the engine rebuilt. The engine has approximately 25,000 miles and the transmission 30,000. State Farm insures it for $17,000. I would hop in and drive it to either coast without worry.  I am old and tired, so I do not have the energy to give it the next redo. It needs a new vision. The paint is rough in places and there is some rust. The driver's side window is cracked, but any glass shop can cut one. The floor pans need work. I have only seen one other on the road. Lots of Chevys.   I had the bumpers and grille straightened. The grille is chromed and the bumpers powder coated. The tail lights are from a 1957 Chevy because they fit so good. This is a fun car to drive. Hard to be inconspicuous though. Everyone waves. Bikers give you the thumb's up. People leave love notes. Hard to be in a hurry when you are filling up with gas.   I would seriously consider a 30'-32' motorhome in comparable condition (everything works, no leaks, no rats) in trade. If you don't know the value of this vehicle or do not have the money to buy it, please don't waste both our time. This is one of the most sought after sedan deliveries. Even Brookline models are classic. I looked for some comparables, and here is what I found.  https://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/1953/Pontiac/Chieftain/1-2-Ton-Sedan-Delivery/Values  https://cars.oodle.com/detail/1953-pontiac-sedan-delivery/ show contact info -ontario-ca/  Text four-0-six-five-three-nine-six-one-four-seven\n",

      "Description 1985 AMC EAGLE WAGON  258 6 Cylinder, 2V  ALL ORIGINAL + restorable  Drive Train Ration  This is a hard to find vehicle- especially on the East Coast. Has been in storage and has not been driven in a few years- when it was on-road, other drivers would take photos of this baby out the window!  Owner is in Philadelphia, PA- I am in Queens and posting on behalf of owner- my phone number is below.  **The AMC Eagle \"was arguably a decade ahead of its time.\"[103] It was a passenger car that \"pioneered the crossover SUV\" category.[6] Introduced in late 1979 for the 1980 model year, it \"was unlike anything on the market\" and in the 2000s \"the somewhat traditional SUV has given way to the 'crossover utility vehicle' ... the market has become saturated with these new crossovers that provide a car-like driving experience with the security of a little more ground clearance and all-wheel drive\" making the AMC Eagle \"about 30 years ahead of the curve.\"[104]  The Eagle had character and survival skills and gained a loyal following.[105] They were a precursor to today's crossover models and the \"vehicles worked well and sold well.\"[3] Total production was 197,449 units in one generation.[32]**  Thanks.\n",
